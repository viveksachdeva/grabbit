Over time, the link:grabbit/src/main/groovy/com/twcable/grabbit/spring/batch/repository[Grabbit Job Repository] which is stored under `/var/grabbit` grows and without pruning the data that it is storing, the performance of the Grabbit Status API degrades slowly.
In order to manage that, there is a `Clean Repository` API available that allows you to delete any Grabbit job history that is older than `X` hours from the time the API was hit.

The usage is :

```
POST /grabbit/jobrepository/clean
Parameter: hours=X

where X is the number of hours.
```

This API will delete all the link:grabbit/src/main/groovy/com/twcable/grabbit/spring/batch/repository/GrabbitJobInstanceDao.groovy[JobInstances], link:grabbit/src/main/groovy/com/twcable/grabbit/spring/batch/repository/GrabbitJobExecutionDao.groovy[JobExecutions], link:grabbit/src/main/groovy/com/twcable/grabbit/spring/batch/repository/GrabbitStepExecutionDao.groovy[StepExecutions] and link:grabbit/src/main/groovy/com/twcable/grabbit/spring/batch/repository/GrabbitExecutionContextDao.groovy[ExecutionContexts] that were either `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` X hours ago from `now`.
