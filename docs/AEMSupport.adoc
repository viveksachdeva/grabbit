* AEM/CQ
* To run Grabbit in your AEM/CQ instance, **you need to install a Fragment Bundle once per instance. It can be found link:https://bintray.com/artifact/download/twcable/aem/dependencies/Sun-Misc-Fragment-Bundle-1.0.0.zip[here]**

== Below details AEM version support for the various releases of Grabbit.
```
v5.x - AEM 6.1
v4.x - AEM 6.1
v3.x - CQ 5.6 and AEM 6.0
v2.x - CQ 5.6
```

Active development is on the "master" branch, which is currently the 5.x version line. Security patches and the like are sometimes back-ported to prior versions.

Of course pull-requests are happily accepted for those that would like to submit things like back-porting features for AEM 5.6, etc.
